      <title>12 Factor Applications for Cloud Native</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1) Codebase – use version control, one codebase tracked in revision control for many deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Dependencies – use a package manager and don’t commit dependencies in the codebase repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Config – store the config in Environment Variable, if you have to repackage your application, you’re doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Backing Services – a deploy of the twelve-factor app should be able to swap out a local MySQL database with one managed by a third party (such as Amazon RDS) without any changes to the app’s code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Build, Release, Run – the twelve-factor app uses strict separation between the build, release, and run stages. Every release should always have a unique release ID and releases should allow rollback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Processes – execute the app as one or more stateless processes, the Twelve-factor processes are stateless and share-nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Port Binding – export services via port binding, The twelve-factor app is completely self-contained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) Concurrency – scale out via the process model. Each process should be individually scaled, with Factor 6 (Stateless), it is easy to scale the services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9) Disposability – maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown, we can achieve this with containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10) Dev/Prod Parity – Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible, the twelve-factor app is designed for continuous deployment by keeping the gap between development and production small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11) Logs – treat logs as event streams, a twelve-factor app never concerns itself with routing or storage of its output stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12) Admin Processes – run admin/management tasks as one-off processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 12-factor App methodology is technology and language agnostic but satisfied by Containers, Microservices, and CI/CD Pipelines with a focus on DevOps. You can access more information on The 12-factor App at &lt;a href=&#34;https://12factor.net/&#34;&gt;https://12factor.net/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Google Maps has gone from location finder to daily travel companion, and India has played a part in its development, says Sanket Gupta, Program Manager, Google Maps
Eight years ago, when I moved to Chennai for college, a relative suggested I get myself a map of the new, unfamiliar city. An actual, physical map. In 2009, this did not seem an outlandish suggestion, as it would take me a while to figure out the many bakkams, konams, pets and pettahs that were interspersed around the city.</description>

      <description>There is now hardly any difference between run-of-the-mill attacks and State-sponsored ones, say security experts
One of the oldest methods of online attacks is breaking into someone’s email. The reports during last year’s US Presidential elections that hackers had stolen e-mails from John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s campaign, reminded everyone how vulnerable e-mails still are.
While targets have remained the same, what has evolved over years are techniques adopted by criminals to mask their trail and thereby make it difficult to investigate and find solutions.</description>

      <description>The spectrum of design work in the context of web and mobile is very wide. Front-end engineering has emerged as a challenging job role in this backdrop, as engineers must combine combine design and User Interface (UI) engineering skills. These skills could be inherent, or they must be acquired on the ‘job’. Design schools are far behind in producing front-end engineers, because the pedagogy paradigm in these institutions does not consider, let alone include, code as a way to produce repeatable elements of interface design.</description>

      <description>Samsung also revealed Bixby, a smart voice assistant to rival Apple’s Siri and Google’s Assistant
After much speculation over its built and specifications over past few months, South Korean giant Samsung on Wednesday launched its flagship device, Galaxy S8, that has a voice assistant.
The device comes in two variants with different screen sizes — the 5.8-inch Galaxy S8 and 6.2-inch Galaxy S8 Plus — and will be available from April 21.</description>

      <title>Twitter eases 140-character limit in replies</title>

      <description>Twitter has found more creative ways to ease its 140-character limit without officially raising it.
Now, the company says that when you reply to someone or to a group usernames will no longer count toward those 140 characters. This will be especially helpful with group conversations, where replying to two, three or more users at a time could be especially difficult with the character constraints.
When users reply, the names of the people they are replying to will be on top of the text of the actual tweet, rather than a part of it.</description>

      <description>WhatsApp already has end-to-end encryption and has said the same would apply to its video-calling feature.
WhatsApp on Tuesday rolled out its video calling feature in a phased manner to over a billion users around the world across multiple platforms (iphone, Android and Windows).
WhatsApp, which currently offers messaging, group chats and voice calling services is hugely popular in India, with over 150 million active users.
In a blog post, the company announced that it was committed to making quality video “available to everyone, not just those who can afford the most expensive new phones or live in countries with the best cellular networks.</description>
