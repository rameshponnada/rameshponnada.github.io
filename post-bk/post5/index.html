                <p>Google Maps has gone from location finder to daily travel companion, and India has played a part in its development, says Sanket Gupta, Program Manager, Google Maps</p>

<p>Eight years ago, when I moved to Chennai for college, a relative suggested I get myself a map of the new, unfamiliar city. An actual, physical map. In 2009, this did not seem an outlandish suggestion, as it would take me a while to figure out the many bakkams, konams, pets and pettahs that were interspersed around the city. But when the touchscreen smartphone gained ground about a year later, and mapping apps took advantage of the screen real estate they offered, that early suggestion seemed a ludicrous remnant of the past.</p>

<p>The convenience is unquestionable, but mapping is tough business, and Sanket Gupta is the first person to admit it. Gupta, who is the program manager for Google Maps, says that the journey to becoming a reliable guide has been a long one. Even as I considered buying a map of Chennai, others around me were using Google’s Mapmaker tool to add details to Google’s offering, enhancing it more rapidly than the company’s own teams could. Mapmaker laid the foundation for Maps as we know it today – though the service has now outlived its purpose, with Google announcing that it will be discontinued by the end of this month, as its core features migrate to the main Maps app.</p>

<p>As the application itself has got more features over the years, Gupta says the goal behind the team’s efforts has remained the same. “We’re always trying to make Maps more comprehensive and relevant, for which you need data. There is always a new flyover coming up, or a road that is closed, and this data helps us make an accurate reflection of the real world.”</p>

<p>Like most other Google services, some of this data comes from users, though Maps relies more heavily on voluntary contributions than the company’s other products. Mapmaker set the ball rolling, and the Maps application itself has been gaining new features, with the Local Guides reward system incentivising users to contribute data about the places they have been to.</p>

<p>Some such features that were developed for the application were inspired by challenges posed by India, says Gupta. “One issue we often face is that many cities do not have proper names for streets, so we started using landmarks for guidance, particularly for navigation. Another feature we developed keeping India in mind is Offline Maps, which was conceived here and has expanded to other countries. Obviously, India is in the top five countries that use it, but it is put to use even in the West in areas known for spotty connectivity.”</p>

<p>The progress made by Maps has been rapid. Turn-by-turn navigation reached India in 2012, rendering many third-party automobile navigation solutions redundant. Offline navigation followed, and just this year, the team has pushed out the option to make personalised lists of locations (earlier only available to Local Guides of Level 4 and above), expanded their Transit public transport assistance system to seven new Indian cities, and provided users the option of sharing their location in real time with loved ones. According to Gupta, the service is also tapping into Google’s machine learning to analyse trustworthy updates submitted to Maps by users, increasing its responsiveness to real-world changes.</p>

<p>Now that the roads are displayed with workable accuracy, Gupta says the focus is on providing people with relevant and helpful information. “We’ve been trying to coordinate with the authorities to update Maps during large-scale events. For example, during Durga Puja in Kolkata, we highlighted the locations of the main pandals on the map, and updated information on procession routes and road blockages during Ganesh Visarjan in Mumbai.” Even on a day-to-day basis, he says that tie-ups with companies like Uber, Zomato and Dineout have been created with the purpose of making Maps more actionable.</p>

<p>The future of Maps is something Gupta is hesitant to discuss at length. “We keep trying new things, and we always come back to our users for feedback, so some projects get implemented and others scrapped.” He does reiterate the statement he brought up multiple times during our conversation. “All our efforts are concentrated on making Maps more usable and accurately represent the real world.”</p>

<p>These efforts were successful for the most part, as I did not have to buy a map all those years ago. However, I came across one of Bengaluru when I moved to the city in 2016, tucked away in a corner in a disused office. The large, framed sheet still holds a nostalgic charm. Unfortunately, nostalgia doesn’t tell you how bad traffic on Kamaraj Road is.</p>
